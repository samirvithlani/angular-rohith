Observerable --> consume data from API -> and 
sibscribe will subcrube Data from observable..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

API CALLING PART FROM ANGULAR:-

1) Include HTTPCLIENT MODULE IN APP.module.ts
eg:
import {HttpClientModule} from '@angular/common/http';
 imports: [
    HttpClientModule
  ],

2)Create service file using command ng g serive doctorservice
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

create object of HttpClient inside construtor
constructor(private htttpClient:HttpClient) { }

inside service create public method for get,update,delete,put,and all apis.....

eg:

public getAllDoctors():Observable<any>{

    return this.htttpClient.get("http://localhost:8080/getalldoctors");
 }

3)insdide your component you have to creatre obejct of service inside construtor:
constructor(private service:DoctorserviceService) { }

you can call methpod of serice using service object inside any method or any lifecyle method
ngOnint(){

	
}

when you call method from service you have to subscribe data from Observable

  this.service.getAllDoctors().subscribe((res)=>{
        this.doctors=res;
      })

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While developing app we need to pass data from one component to another component. there are 2 decorotors are available
@Input @Output

we can pass data in 2 ways
1)Data exchange from parent to child component  @Input
2)Data exchange from child to parent --> @output dec, EventEmmiter




request.setAttribute("inputFromParent","inputText")

request.get("inputFromParent")

EventEmiiter:

this is used to emit event in components, @output devritive to emit custome events syrnoc,async, and register handler funciont by eventemiiter


google compoennt will act as parent component and it will load from router not from app...
you tube will act as chilc compoent nd it will laod from google component.html ....

-----------

you tube ->load from google -->router -> indepenedent
